# WeatherApp
This application allows users to enter a city to obtain current weather as well as a 5-day 
forecast for that city. Current weather includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and 
the UV index value.  User can continue to add cities to this list and when they refresh 
the page, local storage should save search.
